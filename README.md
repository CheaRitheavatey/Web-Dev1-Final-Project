# Web Development 1 Final Project
This **Rkhive** project is part of our course assignment in which we created a
website as a digital library platform for people to explore, discover, and read books
of various genres such as fantasy, thriller, non-fiction, and manga. Moreover, there's also
blog content related to topics such as book reviews, author biography, etc.
